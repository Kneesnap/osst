Here is a small collection of sg utils which are useful for the 
OnStream SCSI tape drives. The stream util has been written from 
scratch. Programs:
* (DG)   sg_map:  sg<->st,sd,sr device map 
* (DG)   sg_scan: an alternative way of getting a list of SCSI devs
* (DG)   sg_simple1: sg example doing an INQUIRY
* (KG,DG)sg_test_rwbuf: Test for SCSI adapters: Writes data to the buffer and
                     read it back for testing. Danger!
* (DG,KG)sginfo: SCSI mode pages access
* (KG,DG)os_dump: dumps OnStream tapes (raw)
* (KG,DG)os_write: writes to OnStream tapes (raw)
* (KG)   stream: userspace buffering

Some apps have been written by me, but most is derived from Doug
Gilbert's collection of sg-utils.
