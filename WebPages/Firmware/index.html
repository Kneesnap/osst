<P>
<A HRef="mailto:Jack.Bombeeck@onstream.com">Jack Bombeeck</A> wrote programs
to update the firmware of OnStream tapes under Linux. These tools are
unfortunately not released with source code, but just as binaries, with the
intention to prevent people from playing with the progam and destroying their
firmware this way. This is not optimal, but I can confirm that those tools
do what they are designed for and did work in my tests. At this moment,
tools are only available for Linux under intel. Feel free to ask Jack or me
for binaries for other platforms.
</P><P>
Those tools use the generic SCSI interface (<TT>/dev/sgX</TT>), but via SCSI
emulation layers they can be used to update IDE (via ide-scsi) and USB (via
usb-storage) drives as well. The binaries have been compiled with
glibc-2.1.2 and libstdc++-libc6.1-2.so.3 (gcc-2.95.2) and should work on
glibc-2.1.3 systems as well (SuSE Linux-6.3, 6.4, 7.0; RH Linux 6.x).
Otherwise you may use the statically linked binaries.
You also need to get the appropriate firmware.
</P><P>
<B>Before you go any further please note: These tools are provided as is
without any warranty neither explicit nor implicit. It is probably possible
to render your OnStream tape devices inoperational by using the tools
inappropriately or by hitting a bug in them. <Em>Use at your own
risk!</Em></B>
