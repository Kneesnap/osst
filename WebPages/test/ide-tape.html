<Center><H1>Onstream IDE tapes (DI-30) with Linux</H1></Center>
This page should help you to get your OnStream DI-30/50 running with Linux.
<H3>ide-scsi &amp; osst</H3>
<EM>This is the recommended way of getting you DI-30 running with
Linux.</EM><Br>
Compile your kernel with support for <TT>ide-scsi
(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI)</TT> and <TT>osst (CONFIG_CHR_DEV_OSST)</TT>.
Depending on where your OnStream DI-30 is on the IDE busses, pass<TT><Pre>
hdX=scsi
</Pre></TT> to the kernel as boot parameter, where <TT>X</TT> is<UL>
<LI><TT>a</TT> for primary IDE channel, master</LI>
<LI><TT>b</TT> for primary IDE channel, slave</LI>
<LI><TT>c</TT> for secondary IDE channel, master</LI>
<LI>...</LI>
</UL>. (You may use <TT>hdX=ide-scsi</TT>, if you prefer 4 additional
characters.)<Br>
Passing boot options is being done via your boot loader; in case you use
LILO, you can enter it at the boot prompt after the name to boot (e.g. <TT>
Linux hdc=scsi</TT>), or you may add it to your <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT>
inside the append parameter: <TT>append = "hdc=scsi ..."</TT> (where the
<TT>...</TT> is a placeholder for other parameters you may want to pass to
your kernel).<Br>
The boot parameter is necessary to prevent the ide-tape driver from grabbing
the device and thus preventing the IDE-SCSI emulation to use it. If you did
not compile ide-tape, you may be able to do without the boot parameter.

<P>Load <TT>ide-scsi</TT> and <TT>osst</TT> if necessary. You should now see
the DI-30 as SCSI device under <TT>/proc/scsi/scsi</TT> and find syslog
messages of the <TT>osst</TT> driver attaching to it. If not, something has
gone wrong and you should check the kernel messages (syslog). Look into
<TT>/var/log/messages</TT>, use <TT>dmesg</TT> or just look at the syslog
console (default: <TT>Ctrl-Alt-F10</TT> on most distributions).</P>
You should be able to use the tape via the <TT>/dev/(n)osstX</TT> devices
nodes now. (Look into the README to create the device nodes.)

<H3>ide-tape</H3>
There has been support for the OnStream DI-x0 drives in the
<TT>ide-tape</TT> driver since quite some time. It has been created by Gadi
Oxman. However, it does not support all the recent features of <TT>osst</TT>
like variable blocksizes and the advanced filemarks. Interchanging tapes
written by <TT>osst</TT> and <TT>ide-tape</TT> therefore does not fully
work.<Br>
Apart from this, some people have reported not to be able to get
<TT>ide-tape</TT> to work at all. I can't comment on this, as I don't have a
DI-x0. You should be able to access the tapes via <TT>/dev/(n)htX</TT>.</Br>
Here are two patches, one against <A HRef="ide-tape-ide2218.dif">2.2.18</A>
and one against <A HRef="ide-tape-2.4.0pre.dif">2.4.0pre</A> that should
help you to get it going, if you really want to use <TT>ide-tape</TT>.
