This page should give some info to potential testers of the kernelspace
driver for the OnStream SC-30/50 tape devices. Via ide-tape, usb-storage and
sbp2, also the DI-30, USB30 and FW-30 can be driven. The latter two require
a 2.4 kernel.
<A Name="driver">
<H3>Driver</H3>
The kernelspace solution to drive the SC-x0 has been created by copying the
original scsi tape driver <TT>st</TT> of Kai Mikasara to <TT>osst</TT> and
changing it in order to support the OnStream device. When being loaded, it
allows to access the OnStream tape via <TT>/dev/osst?</TT> just like normal
tapes using <TT>mt</TT>, <TT>tar</TT>, <TT>amanda</TT>, ... <Br>
The driver currently supports 2.2.1x kernels. A 2.4 version is also
available.<Br>

<A Name="status">
<H3>Status</H3>
<P>The driver has been used by lots of people and should be considered
stable. The version with a fixed blocksize of 32k has been integrated into
the mainstream kernel (2.4.0) and will soon be upgraded to the version that
supports variable blocksize.
<Br>
DISCLAIMER: If you test it, you do it on your own risk. If the driver
crashes your kernel (unlikely, but possible) and you loose important data,
you are on your own. If you use the driver to backup your data and need to
restore it later, but fail, you are on your own again. If something bad
happens to you because of this driver, don't even try to make somebody
responsible for this. There is no warranty of whatever kind. In short:
<EM>The <A HRef="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</A>
applies.</EM></P>

<P>Here comes a list with status updates:
<DL>
<DT>2000-04-05: (osst 0.6.3)</DT>
<DD>The first public ALPHA release for the adventureous testers.</DD>
<DT>2000-04-17: (osst 0.6.4)</DT>
<DD>Should fix the blocking problem.</DD>
<DT>2000-05-02: (osst 0.7.0)</DT>
<DD>Added the "fast open" feature: The headers are cached and if the tape
has not been changed, they don't need to be reread. A list of filesmarks is
now kept in the headers: LIN4 signature. Automatic conversion on write.
Better error recovery.</DD>
<DT>2000-05-14: (osst 0.7.1)</DT>
<DD>Bugfixes. Maintains soft error count.
Successfully tested with firmware 1.05 and 1.08.</DD>
<DT>2000-05-15: (osst 0.7.2)</DT>
<DD>Fix error handling skipping over second header group.</DD>
<DT>2000-05-21: (osst 0.7.3)</DT>
<DD>Fix I/O error on read after seek.</DD>
<DT>2000-05-24: (osst 0.7.9)</DT>
<DD>On own character device (major 206) has been registered. The driver has
been adapted to use it and is now able to coexist with st. (Mostly untested,
sorry!) A <A HRef="README.osst">README.osst</A> file has been added. Some
test's and we'll be ready for BETA!</DD>
<DT>2000-05-27: (osst 0.7.91)</DT>
<DD>Osst coexistance with st in the 2.2.15 kernel tree has now been tested.
After applying the osst-22.diff patch you will find in the sources (see
Download below) st will no longer detect OnStream tape drives other than
the ADR series (which do not need osst). Copy in osst.[ch] as explained in
the README, compile and install a new kernel as usual, create the osst devices
and try it out!</DD>
<DT>2000-06-11: (osst 0.7.99)</DT>
<DD>Adopted ADR 1.4 Tape Format, which standardizes the location of file mark
lists in the Header and disambiguates terminology.</DD>
<DT>2000-06-21: (osst 0.7.99a)</DT>
<DD>Slight changes to the way it is integrated into the kernel. Both osst
and st now use the OSST_SUPPORTS(SDp) macro provided by osst_detect.h in
both detect() and attach(). Kernel patch is against 2.2.16 now.</DD>
<DT>2000-06-25: (osst 0.8.0)</DT>
<DD>BETA Test candidate!
Options can now independently be set in osst_options.h (non-applicable options
from st are dropped). Osst.c now identifies the tape drive with a unique code
rather than as a generic SCSI2 drive.</DD>
<DT>2000-07-16: (osst 0.8.1)</DT>
<DD>Improved handling of opening the device after a 'mt offline'.
Driver now returns error ENOSPC 164 blocks before reaching tape capacity.
This should make volume spanning work now. The 164 blocks allows for two
write errors to be recovered at the end of tape.</DD>
<DT>2000-07-24: (osst 0.8.1 / 0.9.0p1)</DT>
<DD>The 2.4 test version is out there (0.9.0p1)!</DD>
<DT>2000-08-12: (osst 0.8.2 / 0.9.0p2)</DT>
<DD>osst_int_ioctl now uses the Scsi_Cmnd structure allocated by the
caller, as allocating a new one hangs the driver on resource
challenged installations.</DD>
<DT>2000-08-12: (osst 0.8.2 / 0.9.0)</DT>
<DD>Beta test version 0.9.0 for linux-2.4.0-test6.</DD>
<DT>2000-09-24: (osst 0.8.4 / 0.9.2)</DT>
<DD>The drive now ejects the tape with 'mt offline'. Fixed polling algorithm 
in preparation of supporting IDE and USB drives. Osst 0.9.2 needs the version 
of st found in kernel versions 2.4.0-test9-pre6 and later.</DD>
<DT>2000-10-04: (osst 0.8.5 / 0.9.3)</DT>
<DD>Some bugfixes. 0.9.3 now verified to support USB Onstream drives and
big endian platforms such as the Power PC.</DD>
<DT>2000-10-29: (osst 0.8.6 / 0.9.4)</DT>
<DD>Deal with the complications of read errors occurring near but not at the location where
a recovered write error occurred. Better handling of rewriting part of a tape (not recommended).
Made sure tape is left in a suitable position and state when reposition commands fail.</DD>
<DT>2000-12-09: (osst 0.8.7)</DT>
<DD>This version implements blocksizes less than 32k. The default at startup is 512 bytes.
You can change it like this: 'mt defblksize 1024' 
or another size (that divides into 32k) of your choice.
The blocksize for files written is determined by the
default at the time of open. I don't allow changes
during a write.
The blocksize for reading is set to the size used to
write it when you start reading.</DD>
<DT>2000-12-11: (osst 0.8.8)</DT>
<DD>Fixed bug when write error is detected during polling.</DD>
<DT>2000-12-20: (osst 0.8.6.1 / 0.9.4.2)</DT>
<DD>Ported the bugfix which went into 0.8.8 to the versions with a fixed
block size of 32k.</DD>
<DT>2000-12-22: (osst 0.8.6.1 / 0.9.4.3)</DT>
<DD>0.9.4.2 could not be compiled statically into the kernel. Fixed.</DD>
<DT>2001-01-03: (osst 0.8.9)</DT>
<DD>Preceed locate(3000) with locate(0) because some drives go AWOL when they mistakenly
detect BOT during such a locate.</DD>
<DT>2001-01-25: (osst 0.8.10 / 0.9.5)</DT>
<DD>Osst 0.9.5 is for the released kernel 2.4.0. It has now caught up with the version for the
2.2.x kernels and implements blocksizes less than 32k. The locate(0) above should not have been
applied during write error recovery - corrected. Some log output has been rationalized.
Note that recent official kernel trees do now include osst and to upgrade them to these
versions all you need to do is copy the new osst.c and osst.h into /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi
and re-run 'make modules modules_install'.</DD>
<DT>2001-02-08: (osst 0.8.11 / 0.9.6)</DT>
<DD>Fixed a hang of 0.9.6 when using tar's default 10K transfer size.
Fixed a buglet in close of the rewinding device in both versions.</DD>
<DT>2001-03-31: (osst 0.8.12 / 0.9.7)</DT>
<DD>Junfeng Yang (Stanford) reported potential invalid pointer dereferences in two functions within
osst, identified by their CHECKER tool. There was a theoretical possibility that an invalid pointer
would be used, though I doubt that anyone would ever be hit by this. Corrected all the same.</DD>
<DT>2001-06-03: (osst 0.8.13 / 0.9.8)</DT>
<DD>Fixed data corruption problem with error recovery on firmware versions 1.05 and older when 
the error is detected when waiting to skip the config partition (2990-3000).
Fixed off by one in block numbering after [bf]sr and seek.
Rationalized printk log statement severities (see READMEs).
Reflected the ability to use multiple blocksizes in READMEs.</DD>
<DT>2001-10-10: (osst 0.8.14 / 0.9.9)</DT>
<DD>Made changes required to have Arkeia work with osst.
Have 'mt load' open door and wait for medium to be inserted when there is no tape in the drive.
A few minor bug fixes. Tested with kernels 2.2.20pre10 and 2.4.9ac18 respectively.</DD>
<DT>2001-11-01: (osst 0.8.15)</DT>
<DD>Applied missing backport bug fix from 0.9.9.</DD>
<DT>2001-11-11: (osst 0.9.10)</DT>
<DD>Accomodate 64 bit PCI API in linux-2.4.13 that broke osst.
Make recoverable read/write log messages less intimidating.</DD>

There are several possibilities to get the <TT>osst</TT>-driver. For your
convenience, the archives also contain Terry's userspace driver <TT>osg</TT> 
and some tools.
<OL>
<LI>If you're lucky, your distributor has a kernel with a recent version of
the osst driver. Just use it ;-)
<LI>(recommended) Get the very latest <A HRef="onstream-20011111.tar.gz">sources</A>, unpack
them (<TT>tar xvzf onstream-200*.tar.gz</TT>) and compile the driver (<TT>cd
onstream/driver; make</TT>). This only works, if you have a configured Linux
source tree installed in <TT>/usr/src/linux/</TT>. 
Since osst is in the standard kernel tree for quite some time
now, you should have a kernel with some version of the osst driver, e.g, the
<A HRef="onstream-0861-0943.tar.gz"> old 0.8.6.1/0.9.4.3</A> with a fixed
blocksize of 32k. If osst is not in your kernel, you have to apply a patch
to your kernel source tree (osst-22.diff resp. osst-24.diff).
<Br>
To install the driver, do a <TT>make install</TT>, and the driver will be
copied to <TT>/lib/modules/2.2.??/scsi/</TT> resp.
<TT>/lib/modules/2.4.??/kernel/drivers/scsi/</TT>. You need root permissions
for this. You can now load the driver (module) by using <TT>modprobe</TT> and
unload it with <TT>rmmod</TT>.<Br>
<Font Size=-1>If this all looks new and scary to you: Sorry! You may be able
to help us later, when the driver is getting better and better, but right
now, you should better first get familiar with your Linux Operating System,
the kernel, the modules, etc.</Font></LI>

<A Name="di-30">
<H3>DI-30/50</H3>
The recommended way to use the DI-x0 is to go via ide-scsi and osst.
Here's a <A HRef="ide-tape.html">page</A> that explains how this
can be done. It also contains patches for the ide-tape to fix the onstream
support in there.

<A Name="usb30">
<H3>USB30</H3>
The <A HRef="http://www.linux-usb.org/">USB</A> drive USB30 can be used via
the 
<A HRef="http://www2.one-eyed-alien.net/~mdharm/linux-usb/">usb-storage</A> 
driver. Compile it with 
support for the <A HRef="http://www.freecom.com/">FreeCom</A> USB-Atapi
converter <TT>CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_FREECOM</TT>, load it and load your osst

Syslog (<TT>dmesg</TT>) should tell you it has been identified.<Br>
Note: Stability and speed veries between different versions of the kernel's
low-level USB drivers, of the usb-storage driver and the Freecom dongle.
Recently, problems with older versions (9.21 and older) of the dongle have
been reported. (Check <TT>/proc/bus/usb/devices</TT>.)

Should work, provided the low-level Firewire 
(IEEE1394) <A HRef="http://linux1394.sourceforge.net/">Linux drivers</A> 
(ohci1394) and the SCSI protocol interface (sbp2) do their job well.
Currently (12/2001), there still seem to be problems hidden somewhere ...

<A Name="dp-30">
<H3>DP-30</H3>
In theory it could be easy. If there was a parallel port transport driver
which would just transport the SCSI commands over the parallel port and
offered a SCSI driver interface. Then it would work just like IDE and USB.
Unfortunately, I don't know such a driver. If anyone does, please tell me.
