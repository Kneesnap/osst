This page should give some info to potential testers of the kernelspace
driver for the OnStream SC-30/50 tape devices.
<H3>Driver</H3>
The kernelspace solution to drive the SC-x0 has been created by copying the
original scsi tape driver <TT>st</TT> of Kai Mikasara to <TT>osst</TT> and
changing it in order to support the OnStream device. When being loaded, it
allows to access the OnStream tape via <TT>/dev/st?</TT> just like normal
tapes using <TT>mt</TT>, <TT>tar</TT>, <TT>amanda</TT>, ... <Br>
The driver currently supports 2.2.1x kernels. A 2.3/2.4 version will be
added in the future.

<H3>Status</H3>
<P>The driver does not have production quality yet and a few problems are
known or to be expected.<Br>
DISCLAIMER: If you test it, you do it on your own risk. If the driver
crashes your kernel (unlikely, but possible) and you loose important data,
you are on your own. If you use the driver to backup your data and need to
restore it later, but fail, you are on your own again. If something bad
happens to you because of this driver, don't even try to make somebody
responsible for this. There is no warranty of whatever kind. In short:
<EM>The <A HRef="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</A>
applies.</EM></P>

<P>Here comes a list with status updates:
<DL>
<DT>2000-04-05: (osst 0.6.3)</DT>
<DD>The first public ALPHA release for the adventureous testers.</DD>
</DL></P>

<H3>Known problems as of 0.6.3</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The driver does currently prevent from accessing non-OnStream tapes on
the same machine, as it is not able to drive normal tape devices. It can
not coexist with the standard <TT>st</TT> driver, either, as it uses the
same device nodes. This will be fixed in a later version. 
The module can be unloaded after use though.</LI>
<LI>There is a potential to infinitely block the waiting process. In this
case, you are in trouble: The process can not really be killed. This does
not consume CPU power or otherwise blocks your system, but it keeps the
<TT>osst</TT> module busy, such that it can't be unloaded, so the only way
to use the <TT>osst</TT> driver again is to reboot :-( However, the rest of
your system should be unaffected. This problem is being investigated,
currently.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Feedback</H3>
<P>Please report any problems to the 
<A HRef="mailto:osst@linux1.onstream.nl">osst mailing list 
<TT>&lt;osst@linux1.onstream.nl&gt;</TT></A>. The
developers (and soon hopefully other testers) will be reading your report
and potentially ask for more details and try to solve the problem.</P>
<P>Useful bug reports include some info:
<UL>
<LI>What is the problem? (e.g. wrong data is being read) What conditions?
(e.g. tape has been written by userspace onstreamsg-0.9.13) What symptoms?
What related effects? (e.g. kernel crashes afterwards)</LI>
<LI>What driver has been used? What version? What is the firmware revision
of the tape device?</LI>
<LI>Is the bug reproducible?</LI>
<LI>Is the same bug present in the <A HRef="ftp://ftp.orcas.net/pub/linux/onstream/">
userspace driver <TT>osg</TT></A>?</LI>
</UL>
Of course, you are also welcome to report successful operation of the
driver.<Br> Please don't send general Linux SCSI questions to the list.

It's a majordomo list. If you're not yet experienced with this kind of
lists, start with sending a mail with just <TT>help</TT> in the

There are several possibilities to get the <TT>osst</TT>-driver. For your
convenience, the archives also contain Terry's userspace driver <TT>osg</TT> 
and some tools.
<OL>
<LI>(recommended) Get the <A HRef="onstream-20000404.tar.gz">sources</A>, unpack
them (<TT>tar xvzf onstream-2000*.tar.gz</TT>) and compile the driver (<TT>cd
onstream/driver; make</TT>). This only works, if you have a configured Linux source
tree installed in <TT>/usr/src/linux/</TT>. 
To install the driver, do a <TT>make install</TT>, and the driver will be
copied to <TT>/lib/modules/2.2.1?/scsi/</TT>. You need root permissions for
this. You can now load the driver (module) by using <TT>modprobe</TT> and
unload it with <TT>rmmod</TT>.<Br>
If this all looks new and scary to you: Sorry! You may be able to help us
later, when the driver is getting better and better, but right now, you
should better first get familiar with your Linux Operating System, the
kernel, the modules, etc.</LI>
<LI>If you happen to use a ix86 machine with a 2.2.14 Linux kernel 
(e.g. in SuSE Linux 6.4) and a glibc-2.1 based distribution, you should be
able to install and use the <A HRef="onstream-0.9.13_0.6.3-0.i386.rpm">onstream RPM</A>
from SuSE. Install with <TT>rpm -i</TT> or update with <TT>rpm -U</TT>.
If you have a different arch, kernel or libc, you might be able to get the
thing to work by grabbing the <A HRef="onstream-0.9.13_0.6.3-0.src.rpm">source RPM</A>
and recompile it with <TT>rpm --recompile</TT>. This package actually is an
RPM provided by <A HRef="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 
<A HRef="http://www.suse.com/PressReleases/64pr.html">Linux 6.4</A>.
</OL>
If you donwnload and use this driver, you agree to do so under the terms of
the <A HREf="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/">GNU GPL</A>.
<P>Note: It seems that there is a distribution (Debian) which for unknown
reasons ships without device nodes <TT>/dev/st0</TT> for SCSI tapes. If you
miss those, please create them (as root) using
<TT><Pre>
mknod /dev/st0  c 9 0
mknod /dev/nst0 c 9 128
mknod /dev/st1  c 9 1
mknod /dev/nst1 c 9 129
</Pre></TT>
and adjust the permissions according to your needs. (Here, it's
<TT>root.disk 660</TT>).
</P>

<H3>Credits</H3>
<A HRef="../developers.html">Credits</A> go to Willem Riede for developing
this driver. Some contributions come from me, Terry Hardie, and Kai Mikasara
and some of the code was designed after Gadi Oxman's DI-30 (IDE) driver.
Jack Bombeeck did always support this project very well.
