<Center><H1>OnStream Linux SCSI tape driver development</H1></Center>
<A Name="intro"></A>
<P>This page coordinates the development of a Linux tape driver for the
 OnStream SC-30/SC-50 devices. The target is to create a kernel driver to
 provide an st-like interface to the userspace.</P>
<P>This project is a joint effort of indiviuals that try to get their
 OnStream SC-x0 ADR tape drive to run with Linux. They are supported by
 <A HRef="http://www.onstream.com">OnStream</A> and <A HRef="http://www.suse.com">SuSE</A>.
 This machine is dedicated for the support of this and is located in
 Eindhoven, NL. It should be reachable via the IP <TT>195.193.200.24</TT> and
 -- in a few days -- via the name <TT>linux.onstream.nl</TT></A>.
</P>
<P>This web page is a trial to coordinate this effort. Besides from pointers
 to relevant information or software, it should also give a short
 summary of the tools for the developers which are used. It does not provide
 software for the end user! As soon as an alpha version is out there, it will
 be put at some location in order to allow people who want to take the risk
 to play with it. As soon as there is a beta, it will be announced here and
 some download page will be installed.</P>

<A Name="cvs">
<H3>CVS</H3></A>
<P>For the joint development, a <A HRef="http://www.cyclic.com/">CVS</A>
 repository is installed on this machine. It handles the driver sources and
 also the web pages.</P>
<P>The repository contains the modules <TT>WebPages</TT>, <TT>Driver</TT>, 
 <TT>Docu</TT> and <TT>Misc</TT>.</P>
<P>In <TT>Driver</TT> you find the stock 2.2.14 kernel <TT>st</TT> driver and
 some support files like include headers. A branch with the tag <TT>L23</TT>
 is created for the Linux-2.3 versions of the <TT>st</TT>driver. That way,
 changes to the 2.2 version should be easily transferable to the 2.3 branch
 and vice versa. Of course, there can be added new files like scripts to test
 or <TT>TODO</TT> lists ...</P>
<P>The <TT>Docu</TT> directory contains the docu from OnStream, namely the
 ADR spec as a PDF. More documentation will go here. The <TT>Misc</TT>
 directory contains the IDE driver for the OnStream of Gadi Oxman, and the
 userspace OnStream SCSI driver from Terry Hardie. Other sourcecode related
 to the OnStream should also go here.</P>
<P>CVS read access is granted upon request. If you have some small
 contributions, the diffs (use <TT>diff -u</TT>) should be send to the 
 <A HRef="#mailinglist"> mailling list</A> and someone will have a look and
 check it into the 
 CVS. If you are contributing a lot, it will be easier to give you read-write
 access to the repository, so this will happen.</P>

<A Name="mailinglist">
<H3>Mailinglist</H3></A>
<P>A mailing list is there to provide an easy way for the developers to
 communicate. The name is 
 <TT><A HRef="mailto:osst@linux.onstream.nl">osst@linux.onstream.nl</A></TT>,
 and it's a majordomo list. So subscribe requests etc. go to
 <TT>osst-request</TT>.</P>
<P>At the time of writing, the mailing list is unfortunately not yet
 functional. As a sort of replacement, you can get 
 <A HRef=".mailaliases.onstream">this list</A> (in mutt
 <TT>.mailaliases</TT> format) in order to facilitate mailing to all.</P>

<A Name="related">
<H3>Related efforts and resources</H3></A>
<P>Terry Hardie has created a userspace driver, which uses the scsi generic 
 (<TT>sg</TT>) of Linux to access the device. It can be 
 <A HRef="ftp://ftp.orcas.net/pub/linux/onstream/">downloaded</A>.</P>
<P>There is a IDE driver for the OnStream DI-30, which uses the same
 format for the tapes defined by the ADR soec. It was written by Gadi Oxman
 and is most probably going to be integrated into the next kernels.</P>
<P>SCSI specs are unfortunately not freely available. Some copies of the
 draft version of the SCSI-II spec are floating around. Drafts for the
 upcoming SCSI-III have also been seen ... Obviously the comittee think they
 are very clever by hiding it and trying to prevent people from accessing it.
 Shouldn't the bad VESA example tell them, they are wrong. Free software
 would not be possible if all committees would work like that.<Br>

 <DD>CVS is up and running, and almost completely filled with the base data.
     For the mailing list, the DNS entry needs to be there, first.</DD>
