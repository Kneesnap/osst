<Center><H1>OnStream Linux SCSI tape driver development</H1></Center>
<A Name="intro">
<H3>Introduction.</H3>
</A>
<P>This page coordinates the development of a Linux tape driver for the
 OnStream SC-30/SC-50/DI-30/FW-30/USB-30 devices.
 The target, osst, is a kernel driver that
 provides an st-compatible interface to the userspace. The driver is put under
 GPL and submitted to the kernel folks for inclusion into the mainstream
 kernel.</P>
<P>There is an IDE tape driver in the kernel with support for the OnStream DI-30,
 which uses the same basic format for the tapes defined by the ADR spec.
 It was written by Gadi Oxman. The OnStream functionality in
 ide-tape has not been maintained though, so its use is not recommended.</P>
<P>This project is a joint effort of indiviuals that want to get their
 OnStream ADR SCSI / IDE / IEEE1394 / USB tape drive to run with Linux
 and any Backup Software available on Linux.
 The primary author and maintainer is <A HRef="mailto:osst@riede.org">Willem Riede</A>.
 We were supported by
 OnStream and <A HRef="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>.
 Unfortunately OnStream has gone bankrupt and the development has now
 moved to <A HRef="http://sf.net/">SourceForge</A>.
</P>

<A Name="status">
<H3>Status.</H3>
</A><P>
The driver currently supports 2.4.x kernels. A 2.2 version is also
available, but has not been updated with some of the latest fixes.
Likewise, a 2.6 version is available. Osst comes standard with all recent
kernels from <A HRef="http://kernel.org/">kernel.org</A> or your favorite distribution.
</P>
<P>
Download the latest version (which may not yet be merged at kernel.org)
<A HRef="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=84433">here</A>.
</P>
<P>
DISCLAIMER: If you test it, you do it on your own risk. If the driver
crashes your kernel (unlikely, but possible) and you loose important data,
you are on your own. If you use the driver to backup your data and need to
restore it later, but fail, you are on your own again. If something bad
happens to you because of this driver, don't even try to make somebody
responsible for this. There is no warranty of whatever kind. In short:
<EM>The <A HRef="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</A>

<H3>Mailing list</H3></A>
<P>A mailing list is there to provide an easy way for the users and developers to
 communicate. The name is 
 <TT><A HRef="mailto:osst-users@lists.sourceforge.net">osst-users@lists.sourceforge.net</A></TT>,
 and it's a mailman list. To subscribe visit the list's web page at

<H3>Useful Information.</H3>

<UL>
 <LI> There are <A HRef="product_table.html">firmware updates</A> available for various
      OnStream drives.
 <LI> This <A HRef="backupsw.html">page</A> contains important information for using
      osst with various backup software packages.
 <LI> On the <A HRef="http://www.t10.org/">T10 committee web site</A> you can find
      the draft versions on the SCSI specs that underly OnStreams's ADR spec.

<A Name="cvs">
<H3>Development.</H3>
</A>
<P>For the joint development, a <A HRef="http://www.cyclic.com/">CVS</A>
 repository is available on <A HRef="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</A>.

 It handles the driver sources and also the web pages.</P>
<P>The repository contains the modules (=directories) <TT>WebPages</TT>,
 <TT>Driver</TT>,  <TT>Docu</TT>, <TT>Firmware</TT> and <TT>Misc</TT>.</P>

<P>In <TT>Driver</TT> you find osst itself and a bunch of files used in its
 original creation, which are now obsolete. Three branches exist, for the
 2.2 (OSST22), 2.4 (LINUX-2-4) and 2.6 kernel (HEAD).</P>

<P>The <TT>Docu</TT> directory contains the docu from OnStream, namely the
 ADR spec as a PDF. More documentation will go here.</P>

<P>The <TT>Firmware</TT> directory contains DOS and Wind*ws programs to
 update the firmware of your OnStream tape device.</P>

<P>CVS read access is available through
 <A HRef="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=84433">browsing</A>.
 If you have some contributions, the diffs (use <TT>diff -u</TT>) should be sent to the 
 <A HRef="#mailinglist"> mailing list</A> and someone will have a look and
 check it into the CVS. 
 If you are contributing a lot, it will be easier to give you read-write
 access to the repository, so ask to join as a developer.</P>
