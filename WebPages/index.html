<A Name="intro"></A>
<P>This page coordinates the development of a Linux tape driver for the
 OnStream SC-30/SC-50 devices. The target is to create a kernel driver to
 provide an st-like interface to the userspace. The driver will be put under
 GPL and submitted to the kernel folks for inclusion into the mainstream
 kernel.</P>
<P>This project is a joint effort of indiviuals that try to get their
 OnStream SC-x0 ADR SCSI tape drive to run with Linux. They are supported by
 <A HRef="http://www.onstream.com/">OnStream</A> and <A HRef="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>.
 This machine is dedicated for the support of this and is located in
 Eindhoven, NL. It should be reachable via the IP address
 <TT>195.193.200.24</TT> and 
 -- in a few days -- via the name <TT>linux1.onstream.nl</TT></A>.
</P>
<P>This web page is a trial to coordinate this effort. Besides from pointers
 to relevant information or software, it should also give a short
 summary of the tools for the developers which are used. It does not provide
 software for the end user! As soon as an alpha version is out there, it will
 be put at some location in order to allow people who want to take the risk
 to play with it. As soon as there is a beta, it will be announced here and
 some download page will be installed.</P>

<A Name="cvs">
<H3>CVS</H3></A>
<P>For the joint development, a <A HRef="http://www.cyclic.com/">CVS</A>
 repository is installed on this machine. It handles the driver sources and
 also the web pages.</P>
<P>The repository contains the modules (=directories) <TT>WebPages</TT>,
 <TT>Driver</TT>,  <TT>Docu</TT>, <TT>Firmware</TT> and <TT>Misc</TT>.</P>
<P>In <TT>Driver</TT> you find the stock 2.2.14 kernel <TT>st</TT> driver and
 some support files like include headers. A branch with the tag <TT>L23</TT>
 is created for the Linux-2.3 versions of the <TT>st</TT>driver. That way,
 changes to the 2.2 version should be easily transferable to the 2.3 branch
 and vice versa. Here lives the kernel tape driver for OnStream tapes osst.
 Of course, there can be added new files like scripts to test
 or <TT>TODO</TT> lists ...</P>
<P>The <TT>Docu</TT> directory contains the docu from OnStream, namely the
 ADR spec as a PDF. More documentation will go here. The <TT>Misc</TT>
 directory contains the IDE driver for the OnStream of Gadi Oxman, and the
 userspace OnStream SCSI driver from Terry Hardie. Other sourcecode related
 to the OnStream should also go here.</P>
<P>The <TT>Firmware</TT> directory contains DOS and Wind*ws programs to
 update the firmware of your OnStream tape device.</P>
<P>CVS read access is granted upon request. If you have some small
 contributions, the diffs (use <TT>diff -u</TT>) should be send to the 
 <A HRef="#mailinglist"> mailing list</A> and someone will have a look and
 check it into the CVS. 
 If you are contributing a lot, it will be easier to give you read-write
 access to the repository, so this will happen.</P>

<A Name="mailinglist">
<H3>Mailing list</H3></A>
<P>A mailing list is there to provide an easy way for the developers to
 communicate. The name is 
 <TT><A HRef="mailto:osst@linux1.onstream.nl">osst@linux1.onstream.nl</A></TT>,
 and it's a majordomo list. So subscribe requests etc. go to
 <TT><A HRef="mailto:osst-request@linux1.onstream.nl">osst-request</A></TT>.
 </P>

<!--
<P>At the time of writing, the mailing list is unfortunately not yet
 functional. As a sort of replacement, you can get 
 <A HRef=".mailaliases.onstream">this list</A> (in mutt
 <TT>.mailaliases</TT> format) in order to facilitate mailing to all.</P>

<A Name="related">
<H3>Related efforts and resources</H3></A>
<P>Terry Hardie has created a userspace driver, which uses the scsi generic 
 (<TT>sg</TT>) of Linux to access the device. It can be 
 <A HRef="ftp://ftp.orcas.net/pub/linux/onstream/">downloaded</A>.</P>
<P>There is a IDE driver for the OnStream DI-30, which uses the same
 format for the tapes defined by the ADR soec. It was written by Gadi Oxman
 and is most probably going to be integrated into the next kernels.</P>
<P>SCSI specs are unfortunately not freely available. Some copies of the
 draft version of the SCSI-II spec are floating around. Drafts for the
 upcoming SCSI-III have also been seen ...<Br> 
 Actually, you can find the draft versions on the 
 <A HRef="http://www.t10.org/">pages of the T10 committee</A>.
 I don't know, why the ANSI does not allow the final approved versions to be
 freely available.
 Shouldn't the bad VESA example tell them, they are wrong? 
 Free software is in trouble if standards are hidden.<Br>

 <DD>CVS is up and running, and almost completely filled with the base data.
     For the mailing list, the DNS entry needs to be there, first.</DD>
 <DT>2000-03-03</DT>
 <DD>While the userspace osg gets better and better, the kernelspace
     OnStream SCSI tape driver osst starts to become useable. Reading
     and writing basically works, but the error recovery needs to be
     implemented before an alpha release can be published.</DD>
 <DT>2000-03-30</DT>
 <DD>Mailing list is up and running without any problems since some time
     now. Subscribe by sending a mail with <TT>help</TT> in the body to
     <A HRef="mailto:osst-request@linux1.onstream.nl">osst-request@linux1.onstream.nl</A>
     and follow the instructions.</DD>
 <DT>2000-04-06</DT>
 <DD>A <A HRef="test/">tester's page</A> has been set up, where you can find 
     a tarball with the driver (ALPHA state at the moment) to download and
     some instructions on how to use it and how to report success or failure
     back to the developers.</DD>
 <DT>2000-05-05</DT>
 <DD>The <TT>Firmware</TT> dir has been added to CVS</DD>
 <DT>2000-12-15</DT>
 <DD>Alan Cox merged the osst driver 0.8.6 into Linux-2.2.19pre1.<Br>
     Hopefully Linus will accept to merge the osst - 0.9.4 (which is 
     functionally equivalent) into 2.4.0.</DD>
 <DT>2000-12-20</DT>
 <DD>Added notice that the <A HRef="test/">Tester's page</A> is the one
     being interesting ...<Br>
     The osst driver by now is very stable -- thanks to the beta testers --
     and should be prefered over osg. It even works with the IDE device
     (DI-30) over ide-scsi and for the USB (USB30) one via usb-storage.
     For the latter, you need at least a 2.4.0-test12 kernel and you need
     to activate freecom support.</DD>

<H3>Notice</H3>
Since the start of the beta tests in April 2000, most of the recent
development is documented on the <A HRef="test/">tester's page</A>.
Thanks to the testers and the work of Willem, the driver has quickly become
very stable. The
