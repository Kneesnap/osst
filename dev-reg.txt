		"No rewind" refers to the omission of the default
		automatic rewind on device close.  The MTREW or MTOFFL
		ioctl()'s can be used to rewind the tape regardless of
		the device used to access it.
		The OnStream SC-x0 SCSI tapes do not support the standard
		SCSI SASD command set and therefore need their own driver
		"osst". Note that the IDE, USB (and maybe ParPort) versions
		may be driven via ide-scsi or usb-storage SCSI emulation 
		and this osst device and driver as well.
		The ADR-x0 drives are QIC-157 compliant and don't need osst.
